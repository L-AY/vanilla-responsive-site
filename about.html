          <p>The album contains samples such as Stevie Wonder's "Love's in Need of Love Today",
            The Clark Sisters's "Ha Ya (Eternal Life)", Donny Hathaway's "Someday We'll All Be Free",
            and Nina Simone's "Four Women" and "Baltimore". </p>
          <p>Lyrically, Jay-Z touches on an array of topics such as his friendship with Kanye West,
            his infidelity, his mother being a lesbian, and the people in charge of Prince's estate,
            among others.</p>
          <p>No I.D. says Jay-Z approached him about working together, and initially declined. He
            cited feeling "uninspired" and "didn't think [he] had anything at the time" but talks
            about researching Quincy Jones as inspiration to begin work with Jay-Z. It is the first
            time Jay-Z has worked with one producer for an album. No I.D. states he "began to play
            the samples like I would play an instrument."</p>
